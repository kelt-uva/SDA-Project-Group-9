    "\n",
    "**General_Health**: Most people answered this question with 'Very Good' or 'Good', while only a few answered 'Poor'. We note that this is subjective and thus might not be a good indicator of heart disease.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Checkup**: Most people had a checkup in the last year. Note that a recent checkup can cause heart disease to be found earlier, but that still does not say anything about the actual health of that person.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Exercise**: The majority reported to engage in exersice. According to our literature, not engaging in exercise might be a indicator for heart disease.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Heart_Disease**: This shows us that only a small percentage of the people in the dataset actually have heart disease.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Skin_Cancer**: A small minority reported having skin cancer. As far as literature tells us, skin cancer does not have a correlation to heart disease.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Other_Cancer**: Just like skin cancer, other cancer does not have a correlation to heart disease.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Depression**: According to literature, depression may have a relation with heart disease. In the dataset a small amount of people reported having depression.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Diabetes**: Diabetes is known to cause a higher probability to get heart disease. In the dataset a small amount of people reported having diabetes.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Arthritis**: About one third of the people from the survey has arthritis.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Sex**: The dataset is pretty much divided in half.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Age_Category**: Most people filling in the survey are between 45 and 69. The age could be a good indicator for heart disease (according to literature).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Height\\_(cm)**: The distribution of height has two peaks, most likely for male and female. The average length of the people in the dataset is 1.70m.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Weight\\_(kg)**: The average weight is 83.59kg.\n",
    "\n",
    "**BMI**: The average BMI is 28.8. This is considered unhealthy.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Smoking_History**: Most people do not have a history of smoking, but there are a lot of people who do.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Alcohol_Consumption, Fruit_Consumption, Green_Vegetables_Consumption, FriedPotato_Consumption**: The x-axis does not tell us much about the amount of food eaten, so we\n",
    "are not able to make any statements about these graphs.\n"
